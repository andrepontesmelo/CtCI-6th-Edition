# Is Unique

Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures ?

Solution   | Space Complexity | Runtime Complexity | Commit
---------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | -------
HashSet    | O(n)             | O(n)               | bb657b8
Bit Vector | O(1)             | O(n)               | 0f35a8a

- **n** - Length of input string.
